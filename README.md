## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Class selectors, Pseudo classes and Pseudo elements
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The things which I learnt through this challenge has made me confident towards my frontend skills in web-development.

The major learnings which I gained through this challenge is the :

- Importance of CSS Positioning and using it in an advanced manner.
- Being able to breakdown the challenge into small sections to make it easier to complete the task.
- Major use of CSS Flexbox and it's importance.
- Vast use and impact of pseudo elements and pseudo classes in CSS and CSS3.
For example: ::before, ::after, :nth-child() and so on.

### Continued development

During the process of completing this project I found some concepts which I still have to practice a lot. And so the lack of skill came forth when I was trying to implement a background-color overlay over the image.

I tried many different tricks to work out with that particular problem but the solution which I was able to discover later on by myself was quite simple.

So, I think keep pratcing to improve my skills at frontend development and won't stop until I become a full-stack-web-developer.
